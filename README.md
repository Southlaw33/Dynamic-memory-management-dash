This is a memory management dashboard which offers a range of features to facilitate effective memory management :

1)	Real-time Monitoring: The dashboard continuously tracks memory usage patterns in real time, allowing users to observe how memory is being allocated and utilized as the application runs.

2)	Memory Allocation Analysis: Developers can identify instances of excessive memory allocation, detect memory leaks (unreleased memory), and pinpoint potential memory fragmentation issues.

3)	Memory Usage Visualization: The dashboard displays memory consumption trends using charts, graphs, and heatmaps, enabling users to quickly identify memory-intensive areas.

4)	Memory Leak Detection: By tracking allocated memory blocks and their references, the dashboard can detect memory leaks, helping developers find and fix these issues before they impact system stability.
